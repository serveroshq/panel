# Extending the panel from a package

The panel can be extended by Laravel packages installed under `vendor/serveroshq/`, without the panel knowing about them. The paid features work this way: `serveroshq/panel-ee` is in the official self-hosted image (`ghcr.io/serveroshq/panel`), where it stays off until a workspace adds a license key. serveros.com adds what only the hosted service needs, like billing and its website, with a package of its own.

The panel never refers to a package. Each one registers itself from its service provider through `App\Support\Extensions\Extensions`, and everything below works the same for yours.

## What a workspace may use

Ask the workspace, never the plan: `$workspace->hasFeature(Feature::Sso)`, `$workspace->limitOf(Limit::Machines)`, `$workspace->isActive()`. `App\Support\Entitlements` answers from the plan on serveros.com (`SERVEROS_EDITION=cloud`) and from the edition on a self-hosted install (`SERVEROS_EDITION=self-hosted`).

On a self-hosted install with panel-ee, a workspace's ServerOS Business license adds to the free edition: panel-ee puts its `LicenseEntitlements` in front of `SelfHostedEntitlements` (with `$app->extend`), adding the key's features and machine allowance. Keys are signed by serveros.com's license server and checked offline.

## Routes

```php
use App\Support\Extensions\Extensions;

$this->app->make(Extensions::class)->routes(Extensions::WORKSPACE, function () {
    Route::get('settings/sso', [SsoController::class, 'show'])->name('workspace.settings.sso');
});
```

| Slot                     | Loaded                                                     | You get                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Extensions::WORKSPACE`  | Inside the workspace's subdomain group in `routes/web.php` | Its middleware (signed in, verified, can view the workspace, SSO, two-factor and so on) and the `{workspace}` binding. Name routes `workspace.*`.    |
| `Extensions::SIGN_IN`    | With the panel's own sign-in routes in `routes/web.php`    | Every host, with the `web` middleware group, ahead of the docs, feedback and workspace hosts (panel-ee's `sso/*`).                                   |
| `Extensions::WEB`        | At the end of `routes/web.php`                             | The main domain, with the `web` middleware group.                                                                                                    |
| `Extensions::API`        | At the end of `routes/api.php`                             | The `api` prefix and middleware group. Add `AuthenticateApiKey` yourself for the public API.                                                         |
| `Extensions::ADMIN`      | At the end of the admin group in `routes/web.php`          | Prefix `admin`, names `admin.*`, signed in, verified and `can:viewAdmin`.                                                                            |
| `Extensions::MCP`        | In `routes/mcp.php`, ahead of the workspace subdomains     | The `api` group and `McpCors`, every host (a package's own OAuth metadata, or an MCP server on its own subdomain, like `docs.`).                     |
| `Extensions::SUBDOMAINS` | In `routes/web.php`, ahead of the workspace subdomains     | The `web` middleware group. For sites on their own subdomain (`Route::domain('docs.'.config('app.domain'))`), so the name never reaches a workspace. |

On a workspace's own domain, account pages (profile, security, accepting an invitation) open on our domain instead, so a session there never changes the account. Name a package's account routes the same way:

```php
$extensions->addAccountRoutes(['referrals.apply']);
```

Register from the provider's `boot()`: the route files load after every provider has booted. Not from `register()`: package providers register before the panel's AppServiceProvider makes Extensions a singleton, so what they add there is lost. Use controllers, not closures, so `route:cache` keeps working.

## Pages

Put Vue pages in the package's `resources/js/pages/`, named like the panel's own: `resources/js/pages/workspace/settings/Sso.vue` renders as `workspace/settings/Sso` and gets the same layout a page of that name gets in the panel. The panel's page lookup (`resources/js/lib/pages.ts`) looks in `vendor/serveroshq/*` as well as the panel. If a package and the panel both have a page, the panel's wins.

Import panel code with `@/` as usual, and the package's own files with relative paths. Tailwind scans `vendor/serveroshq/*/resources/js`, and the Vite dev server may serve packages Composer linked from a folder next to the panel. `npm run types:check` checks packages' Vue pages with the panel's `tsconfig.json` and their React code (`resources/js/marketing`) with `tsconfig.react.json`.

## A website

The panel has no website of its own: without a package, `/` opens on the dashboard (or on signing in, or on making an install's first account, `App\Support\Edition::home`) and every page is the panel's. A package can bring a website, a React app with its own Inertia root, and the panel builds and serves it:

- **Its pages and root view:** `$extensions->setMarketingSite(new MarketingSite(rootView: 'saas::marketing', routes: ['home', 'pricing', 'legal.*', ...]))`. Pages on those routes (`routeIs` patterns) render in that Blade view with their own asset version (so going between the panel and the site is a full page load), and only they go to the SSR server, in English. The error page on the main domain and its `docs.` and `feedback.` subdomains uses the view too. The package registers its own `/` (named `home`), and the panel's leaves it alone.
- **Its app:** `resources/js/marketing/app.tsx` (the browser) and `resources/js/marketing/ssr.tsx` (the SSR bundle, `npm run build:ssr`). `vite.config.ts` finds them in `vendor/serveroshq/*` and adds them as entries; without them there's no React entry and no SSR bundle. The site looks up its own pages; the Blade view loads `resources/css/app.css`, the app, and `Extensions::pageEntry($component, 'marketing/pages', 'tsx')`.
- **Its styles:** `resources/css/app.css` has `@package-css 'file.css';` rules, each where the styles belong among the panel's. The build turns each into an import of the package's `resources/css/file.css` when one has it, or drops it (`packageStyles()` in `vite.config.ts`, ahead of Tailwind). It isn't an `@import` so that tools reading `app.css` on their own (the formatter's class sorting) don't stop at a missing file. Add a rule there when a package needs one.
- **Its public files:** a package's `public/` folder (images, `install.sh`, `robots.txt` and the like) is copied into the panel's `public/` at the same paths when Vite builds or the dev server starts, with a `.gitignore` in each folder they land in, so they stay out of the panel's git status. A file the copy would overwrite must not be one the panel tracks. The panel answers `/install.sh` and `/robots.txt` from routes, and a web server serves a file in `public/` before it asks the panel, so a package's copy of either wins.
- **Its fonts:** a package's `resources/fonts/web/fonts.json` names the families it brings, `{"PP Mondwest": {"weights": [400], "preload": [400]}}`, with their files beside it (`pp-mondwest-400.woff2`). `vite.config.ts` adds them after the panel's own, so its root view can list them in `@fonts` and a build without the package has only the panel's.
- **Its icons:** `node scripts/solar-icons.mjs` also writes the site's `lib/solarIcons.tsx` and `lib/docIcons.tsx` into the package that has `resources/js/marketing/lib`, and the build splits the site's icon imports one module per icon, as it does the panel's.

A package's write routes in a workspace, account settings or `/admin` say whether they're audited (`#[Audited]` or `#[NotAudited('why')]`) like the panel's: the audit coverage test checks `ServerOS\` controllers too.

## Sidebar sections and settings pages

```php
use App\Support\Extensions\NavItem;
use App\Support\Extensions\SettingsItem;

$extensions->addNavItem(new NavItem(
    key: 'ledger', label: 'Ledger', icon: 'credit-card', path: '/ledger',
    group: 'workspace', components: ['workspace/Ledger'], after: 'members',
    visible: fn (Workspace $workspace, ?User $user) => $user?->can('manageBilling', $workspace) === true,
));

$extensions->addSettingsItem(new SettingsItem(
    key: 'sso', label: 'Single sign-on', icon: 'lock', path: '/settings/sso',
    group: 'workspace', component: 'workspace/settings/Sso', keywords: 'saml oidc okta entra',
    visible: fn (Workspace $workspace) => $workspace->hasFeature(Feature::Sso),
));
```

`after` names the item it goes after; `before` names one it goes before, which wins when that item shows (Billing uses `after: 'members', before: 'settings'`). In the sidebar, Settings stays last in its group. A page in an item's `components` that isn't one of the top tabs shows the item's label as its breadcrumb.

Only the items whose `visible` check passes are shared with the page, as the `extensions` prop on workspace pages. Labels are in English and translated when shared. Icons are names from `resources/js/lib/extensionIcons.ts`; add one there if you need it. Sidebar groups are `start`, `servers`, `operations`, `workspace` and `menu`. Settings groups are `workspace`, `machines`, `developers` and `account`.

On a self-hosted install, a settings item with the key `license` is Settings › License. Without one (an install built from source), the panel shows its own there, `App\Support\Licensing\CommunityLicense`: it says the install is the community edition and how to switch to the official image. It never shows on serveros.com.

## The admin's sidebar

`resources/js/layouts/AdminLayout.vue` shows the admin pages the panel serves itself (`App\Support\Admin\AdminPages`: Laravel Pulse) and the packages':

```php
use App\Support\Extensions\AdminNavItem;

$extensions->addAdminNavItem(new AdminNavItem(
    key: 'tickets', label: 'Tickets', icon: 'hammer', path: '/admin/tickets',
    group: 'home', components: ['admin/tickets/*'], badge: 'ticketsUnread',
));
```

Groups are `home`, `customers`, `growth`, `content`, `platform` and `tools` (the row of icons at the bottom, outside services that open in a new tab), in that order; one with nothing in it isn't shown, so an install with no admin pages has no sidebar to show. `components` are the pages it's the current one on, and one ending in `*` matches every page that starts with the rest. `after` and `before` place it next to another item, whichever was added first; without them it goes in the order added. `visible` gets the user; without it, anyone who can `viewAdmin` sees it (an item can use another gate, so people who may only see one page get that and nothing else). `badge` names a page prop with a count, which the package shares itself (below), so a partial reload of it updates the badge. `external: true` is a full page load, like Laravel Pulse. Icons are names from `resources/js/lib/adminIcons.ts`. Admin pages get the sidebar as the `adminNav` prop.

The layout has two `ExtensionSlot`s, `layouts/AdminLayout/main-end` (at the end of the page) and `layouts/AdminLayout/after-main` (beside it, for something fixed to the window), where a package can put something like an assistant.

## Props on every page

```php
$extensions->addSharedProps(fn (Request $request) => [
    'ticketsUnread' => fn () => $request->routeIs('admin.*') ? Tickets::unreadFor($request->user()) : 0,
]);
```

They come after the panel's own shared props, so they never move or replace one. Give a closure as a value to work it out only when it's sent.

## What a token can be for: OAuth audiences

The panel's MCP OAuth server issues tokens for a workspace's MCP server (`App\Support\Mcp\WorkspaceAudience`). A package with its own MCP server adds an audience, a subclass of `App\Support\Mcp\OAuthAudience`:

```php
$extensions->addOAuthAudience(new TicketsAudience);
$extensions->keepOnMainDomain(['tickets.mcp']);
```

It says its `key()` (stored as `audience` with its codes and tokens, so never change it), its `scopes()` (listed in the server metadata's `scopes_supported`, after the workspace's), `describe()` and `normalise()` for them, which authorization requests it `claims()` by their `resource`, its `consent()` page (what to keep until the person decides, and the page's props) and what `approve()` grants (`OAuthGrant`: the scopes, the resource and a workspace, if any). Either can return a response instead, like `OAuthPage::problem()`. The consent page (`auth/OAuthAuthorize`) knows a package's audience by a `{key}: true` prop and shows the copy in the package's `resources/js/oauth/{key}.ts` (`OAuthAudienceCopy`). A code or token for an audience nothing installed knows can't be exchanged or refreshed. Its protected resource metadata is the package's own route, in the `MCP` slot. `keepOnMainDomain` names routes whose URLs stay on our domain on a workspace's own domain, as the MCP and API routes do.

## The admin audit log

`App\Models\AdminAction` records what admins do, and what it was about by a short name (`target_type`). A package's models need theirs:

```php
$extensions->addAuditTarget('ticket', Ticket::class, fn (Ticket $ticket) => $ticket->title);
```

`AdminAction::targets()` has the panel's (`AdminAction::TARGETS`) and the packages'. Never change a name once there are rows.

## Account events

`App\Models\AccountEvent` keeps what happened to an account, shown on Settings › Security and the admin's user page. A package that records its own event says how it reads, in English and said to the person; it's translated when shown:

```php
AccountEvent::record($user, 'ledger.profile', ['changed' => ['name']]);
$extensions->addAccountEvent('ledger.profile', 'Changed your ledger profile');
```

An event no package describes shows its name.

## Events

The panel dispatches Laravel events where a package needs to act on something core does. Listen with `Event::listen` from the provider:

| Event                          | When                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `App\Events\DeployQueued`      | A deploy was handed to a machine's daemon, with the domains it asked for. Listeners run before the deploy call returns.                                                   |
| `App\Events\WorkspaceCreated`  | A workspace was made for its owner (signing up, from the switcher, or by an admin). Listeners run before `CreateWorkspace` returns it.                                    |
| `App\Events\EmailUnsubscribed` | Someone asked to stop getting email at an address, with the link in an email (`Unsubscribes::add`), the address normalised. Listeners run before the page says it's done. |

## The upgrade link

The dashboard's "upgrade", "choose a plan" and plan limit prompts (the workspace menu, the command palette, the plan banner, Connect machine at the limit, plan locks) all go to one place, which a package supplies:

```php
use App\Support\Extensions\UpgradeLink;

$extensions->setUpgradeLink(new UpgradeLink(label: 'Billing', route: 'workspace.billing.show'));
```

Workspace pages get it as the `upgrade` prop, `{href: '/billing', label: 'Billing'}` (Vue: `useUpgradeLink()`), and PHP asks `$extensions->upgradeUrl($workspace)` for the full address. With none set, `upgrade` is null and those prompts show no link.

## The Powered by link

A workspace's public status pages say "Powered by ServerOS" and its workflow emails "Sent with ServerOS", linking to the install's own address. A package can send that link somewhere else, per workspace:

```php
$extensions->setPoweredByLink(fn (Workspace $workspace) => 'https://example.com/?ref='.$workspace->slug);
```

`$extensions->poweredByUrl($workspace)` gives the package's address, or `config('app.url')` with none set.

## Off limits while viewing as someone

An admin viewing as someone can look but not act as them in some places. A package names its routes and what the admin is told:

```php
$extensions->offLimitsWhileViewingAs(['workspace.billing.checkout'], 'You’re viewing as this person, so billing is off limits.');
```

## A card before the trial

Whether a new signup's trial has to add a card before its dashboard opens is asked of `App\Support\Extensions\TrialCards`, by workspace creation and the welcome flow's plan step. The panel binds `NoTrialCards` (never); a package with a checkout can bind its own:

```php
$this->app->singleton(TrialCards::class, CheckoutTrialCards::class);
```

- `assign($owner, $workspace)`: called while a new trial workspace is made, before it's saved, when its owner made it. The package sets whatever it keeps on the workspace (its own columns, from its own migrations) to decide later whether a card is needed.
- `needsCard($workspace)`: whether the welcome flow and dashboard wait for a card.
- `awaitingFirstCharge($workspace)`: whether a trial that added a card is past its end but not charged yet, so it keeps its trial plan until the charge lands.
- `trialDays`, `verifyPath` and `checkout`: what the welcome flow's card step shows and where it sends people.

While the welcome flow confirms a trial's card, back from checkout, it says what `resources/js/lib/trialCards.ts` gives it: the default words, or a package's own `resources/js/trialCards.ts` (its default export, a `TrialCardsCopy`), which can name its checkout. The strings are in English and go through `$t`.

## How a plan is paid for

The panel keeps a workspace's plan, trial and allowances, but never talks to a payment provider. What it needs to know about a subscription it asks `App\Support\Extensions\Billing`:

- `isBilled($workspace)`: whether a subscription pays for the plan right now (active, or a payment that's late).
- `currency($workspace)`: the currency the subscription is charged in, so prices show in it (`Currency::forWorkspace`); null goes by the visitor.
- `summary($workspace)`: what the workspace's pages are told (`Workspace::billingSummary`): the subscription's status, whether there's a portal to manage it in, and the contract it's on, if any.

The panel binds `NoBilling` (nothing is billed); a package with a checkout binds its own from `register()`:

```php
$this->app->singleton(Billing::class, LedgerBilling::class);
```

## What a plan costs

The panel knows each plan's limits and features but not its price. Where it shows one (the welcome flow's plan step, `Plan::toPageProps`, `McpUsage::summary`), it asks `App\Support\Extensions\Prices`, in minor units:

- `plan($plan, $interval, $currency)`: what the plan costs for a month or a year.
- `mcpPack($currency)`: what a pack of `McpUsage::PACK_CALLS` AI tool calls costs.

The panel binds `NoPrices`, which returns null, and pages then leave the price out. A package with prices binds its own from `register()`, and can share them on every page as `pricing` (`currency`, `symbol`, `plans.<plan>.monthly` and `.annual`, `mcpPack`), which the upgrade dialog shows when it's there:

```php
$this->app->singleton(Prices::class, ListPrices::class);
$extensions->addSharedProps(fn (Request $request) => [
    'pricing' => fn () => ListPrices::forPage(Currency::forVisitor($request)),
]);
```

## Docs for Ask AI

Ask AI in the panel adds the docs pages that best match the question to its prompt. It asks `App\Support\Extensions\DocsSource` for them: `search($question, $limit)` returns a list of `['title' => ..., 'url' => ..., 'body' => ...]` (the body in Markdown), best first. The panel binds `NoDocs`, which finds nothing, and the prompt then has no docs. A package with docs binds its own from `register()`:

```php
$this->app->singleton(DocsSource::class, SearchedDocs::class);
```

## Parts of panel pages

A package can add to a page the panel renders, without the panel knowing what it adds:

```php
// Props on the page, merged in by its controller (it calls pagePropsFor).
// The workspace is null on pages outside one, like auth/Login.
$extensions->addPageProps('workspace/settings/Members', fn (Request $request, ?Workspace $workspace) => [
    'scim' => $request->user()?->can('manageMembers', $workspace) ? ScimSettings::for($workspace) : null,
]);

// Fields on each member of the members list, by user id.
$extensions->addMemberProps(fn (Workspace $workspace, array $userIds) => [/* id => ['scim' => true] */]);
```

The page shows them through an `<ExtensionSlot name="..." :parts="slotParts">` (`resources/js/components/ExtensionSlot.vue`): every package component in `resources/js/slots/{name}/*.vue` renders there, in file name order, with the slot's attributes as props. Read the page's props, including the ones you added, with `usePage()`. The page finds the parts itself, with an eager `import.meta.glob` of `vendor/serveroshq/*/resources/js/slots/{page}/**/*.vue`, so they're in the page's own chunk and render with it. Slots so far:

| Page                          | Slot                                               | Gets                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspace/settings/Members`  | `workspace/settings/Members/after-invitations`     | `workspaceName`, `roleOptions` (the roles people can be given here) |
| `workspace/settings/Security` | `workspace/settings/Security/after-google-sign-in` | `workspaceName`                                                     |
| `auth/Login`                  | `auth/Login/notices`                               | nothing                                                             |
| `auth/Login`                  | `auth/Login/sign-in-options`                       | `lastUsed`                                                          |

The sign-in layout (`resources/js/layouts/auth/AuthPanelLayout.vue`) has one too, `layouts/AuthPanelLayout/art`: what a package puts there shows beside the form on every sign-in page. With nothing in it, the form sits in the middle of the page.

Add a slot to a page, and a `pagePropsFor` call to its controller, when a package needs one. Give the page `defineOptions({ inheritAttrs: false })`, so props it doesn't declare don't land on its root element.

## Middleware

```php
$extensions->addMiddleware(Extensions::WORKSPACE_SIGN_IN, RequireWorkspaceSso::class);
$extensions->addMiddleware(Extensions::WORKSPACE, RequireCardForTrial::class);
```

Middleware goes into a slot that keeps its place in a list, in the order packages add it. The workspace group has two, so a sign-in check runs with the panel's and a check on the workspace itself runs once the person is fully signed in. Either way it runs on every route in the group, a package's own and the panel's:

| Slot                            | Runs                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Extensions::WORKSPACE_SIGN_IN` | In the workspace group's sign-in checks, after the Google sign-in check and before two-factor (panel-ee's SSO requirement).       |
| `Extensions::WORKSPACE`         | In the workspace group's middleware, after two-factor and before the visit is recorded.                                           |
| `Extensions::WEB`               | On every request with the `web` group, after `AccountGuard` (through `RunPackageWebMiddleware`, since that group is set earlier). |
| `Extensions::WEB_END`           | On every request with the `web` group, last in it.                                                                                |
| `Extensions::PASSWORD_SIGN_IN`  | In Fortify's password sign-in steps, before the code prompt. Steps take `handle($request, $next)` like middleware.                |

So the workspace group runs: signed in, verified, can view the workspace, Google sign-in, `WORKSPACE_SIGN_IN`, two-factor, `WORKSPACE`, the visit recorded, the workspace's own domain.

## Signing in and out

Extend `App\Support\Extensions\SignInHooks` and override what you need, then `$extensions->addSignInHooks(new MySignInHooks)`. The panel asks every one: `signInRoutes()` (a package's sign-in routes, for the account's history), `refuseSocialSignIn()` (turn down Google or GitHub), `signedIn()`, `challenged()` (at the code prompt), `signingOut()` (where to send the browser after), `meetsTwoFactor()` (a session that meets a workspace's two-factor requirement your way) and `handoff()` / `receiveHandoff()` (what a session carries to a workspace's own domain). panel-ee's single sign-on uses all of them.

## Signing up

Extend `App\Support\Extensions\SignUpHooks`, then `$extensions->addSignUpHooks(new MySignUpHooks)`. When someone signs up, with the form or with Google or GitHub, the panel calls every one's `signedUp()` with the new account, in the sign-up's transaction and before its first workspace is made, and asks `source()` for a few words on where it came from (the first answer wins).

## Errors on a package's own endpoints

```php
$extensions->addExceptionRenderer(fn (Throwable $e, Request $request) => $request->is('scim/*') ? Scim::error(...) : null);
```

Asked first, before the panel's API errors and error pages. Return null for requests that aren't yours.

## The install ping

A self-hosted install sends serveros.com an anonymous ping once a day (`App\Support\InstallPing`, described for installs in `docs/self-hosting.md`). A package can add a number or a yes/no to it, and nothing else:

```php
$extensions->addInstallStat('licensed', fn () => Licenses::anyValid());
```

Only a whole number (0 or more) or a boolean is sent; anything else, or a check that throws, is left out. Names are snake_case and can't be the ping's own fields, apart from `licensed`, which is `false` until panel-ee answers it. Whatever a package adds shows in `php artisan install:ping --show`, and serveros.com ignores fields it doesn't know.

## A package's columns on the panel's tables

A package's migrations can add columns to the panel's tables (`loadMigrationsFrom`). When one needs a cast, add it to the model's:

```php
$extensions->addModelCasts(Workspace::class, ['ledger_synced_at' => 'datetime']);
```

The model's `casts()` puts them before its own, so the panel's always win. `Workspace` asks for them; add the call to another model's `casts()` when a package needs it there.

## Everything else

Use Laravel's own package tools: `loadMigrationsFrom`, `mergeConfigFrom`, `commands`, and `callAfterResolving(Schedule::class, ...)` for scheduled jobs.

A package's own strings go in its `lang/{code}.json`, loaded with `loadJsonTranslationsFrom` for `__()`. The build merges them into the panel's `lang/{code}.json` wherever the front end imports one (`packageTranslations()` in `vite.config.ts`), so `$t` has the same lines; the panel's line wins when both have a key. Where the panel's config is neutral (`mail.support.address`, `services.seline.token`, `daemon.install_script`, who runs the install in `serveros.brand.*`), a package can fill in its own from `register()` when the environment left it empty.

The front-end build reads a package's `build.env.json` (`{"NAME": "value"}`) for settings neither the environment nor `.env` gives, like a Sentry project (`SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_URL`). Config keys the panel used to have keep their names: merge a package's `config/cloud.php` as `cloud`, or a file of extra services as `services`. Page props every page gets go through `Inertia::share()` in the provider's `boot()`; the panel's own shared props are merged over them, so don't reuse a name the panel shares.

## Installing a package

Require it in the panel's `composer.json` like any other (from its Git repository, as a `vcs` repository, if it isn't on Packagist), and `composer.lock` pins the commit. A package in a private repository needs Composer to have a token that can read it: `composer config --global github-oauth.github.com <token>` on your machine, or a `COMPOSER_AUTH` JSON in CI and in Docker builds.

To ship a package change, push it to the package, then run `composer update serveroshq/your-package` in the panel and commit `composer.lock`. Nothing changes where the panel runs until the lock does.

## Developing a package

Clone it next to the panel, then swap the installed copy for a link to your clone, so edits show straight away:

```sh
rm -rf vendor/serveroshq/your-package
ln -s ../../../your-package vendor/serveroshq/your-package
composer dump-autoload
```

Vite keeps a linked package's path (`preserveSymlinks`), so its pages import from the panel. `composer install` puts the locked copy back.
