ServerOS runs the Linux servers you already own from one place. Connect a VPS from any provider with one command, then deploy apps, sites and databases, watch them, back them up and fix them, without living in a terminal. Your servers stay with your provider, on your account.

This repo is the panel, the web app you and your team work in. Each server runs [serverosd](https://github.com/serveroshq/daemon), a small daemon the panel talks to. [serveros.com](https://serveros.com) runs this same panel as a hosted service.

## What's in it

- **Machines**: connect a server with one command, see CPU, memory and disk, and install updates.
- **Services and projects**: deploy from Git or a template, with domains and HTTPS, and copy a project to a test environment before it goes live.
- **Backups, monitors and logs**: scheduled backups, uptime checks with alerts, status pages, and every service's logs in one place.
- **Workflows**: run steps on a schedule, on a push or by hand, like deploy, check and promote.
- **Teams**: members, roles, two-factor sign-in and an activity log.
- **AI and the API**: an MCP server and an API, so your own tools and assistants can work with your servers.

## Self-hosting

You need a Linux server with Docker, ports 80, 443 and 8443 open, and a domain like `panel.example.com` with two A records pointing at the server: one for `panel.example.com` and one for `*.panel.example.com`.

Then run this on the server:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serveroshq/panel/main/docker/self-hosted/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --domain=panel.example.com --email=you@example.com
```

It installs Docker if it's missing, runs the official image (`ghcr.io/serveroshq/panel`) and prints a setup code. Open `https://panel.example.com`, enter it, and the installer walks you through email and your first account. `serveros-panel setup-code` shows the code again if you lose it.

Then connect your servers from Machines › Connect machine. Each one runs [serverosd](https://github.com/serveroshq/daemon), the open source daemon, which connects out to your panel on port 8443.

[docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) covers the rest: building the community edition yourself, installing without Docker, upgrades, backups, connecting machines, and the anonymous daily ping (and how to turn it off).

## Editions

| Edition                                     | What's in it                                                          | License                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Community, built from this repo             | The panel                                                             | [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE), free                  |
| Official image (`ghcr.io/serveroshq/panel`) | The panel plus `serveroshq/panel-ee`, off until you add a license key | AGPL-3.0, and panel-ee under its own terms |
| [serveros.com](https://serveros.com)        | The panel, hosted for you                                             | A paid service                             |

Without a key, the official image works exactly like the community edition. A license turns on single sign-on, SCIM, custom roles, your own domains and the other paid features, with nothing to reinstall. [LICENSING.md](.github/LICENSING.md) explains what that means for you. The daemon is [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/serveroshq/daemon/blob/main/LICENSE) too.

## Development

You need PHP 8.4, Composer, Node 22 and npm. SQLite works out of the box.

```sh
composer setup   # install, .env, key, migrate, build
composer dev     # the panel, queue worker, logs and Vite together
```

Workspaces live on subdomains, so set these in `.env` and open `http://serveros.localhost:8000`:

```dotenv
APP_URL=http://serveros.localhost:8000
APP_DOMAIN=serveros.localhost
SESSION_DOMAIN=.serveros.localhost
```
